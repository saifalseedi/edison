# Intel® Edison and the relayr Cloud

## Introduction

The [Intel® Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html) is a single-board computer with a Silvermont dual-core Intel Atom CPU, integrating WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, 1 GB DDR, 4 GB eMMC flash memory and USB controllers. The 40 multiplexed GPIO pins, high computing power and connectivity capabilities allow rapid industrial IoT and fog computing prototyping.

In this repository, you will find tutorials and code examples of how to make use of the Edison as a sensor node with different relayr's Fog-based Starter Kits, as well as with the Edison alone, using two languages: Python and Arduino.

## Select Your Hardware

Before getting started, **select the model of the Starter Kit you will be using from the list below**. relayr's Starter Kits include Vertex-enabled gateways, which require different configurations for your board.

On the other hand, **if you don't have a Starter Kit and want to run these examples with the Edison alone, or with an IoT Sensor Kit, simply choose the last option**.

* [IoT Acceleration Starter Kit](https://github.com/relayr/edison/blob/master/README_IoT_Acceleration_Starter_Kit.md)
(incl. hardware from Dell, Intel®, Bosch Connected Devices, and other vendors)
* [Industrial IoT Starter Kit](https://github.com/relayr/edison/blob/master/README_Industrial_IoT_Starter_Kit.md) (incl. hardware from Cisco, Intel®, ifm electronic, and other vendors)
* [I am not using any Starter Kit](https://github.com/relayr/edison/blob/master/README_No_Starter_Kit.md). Select this option if you will be working with the Edison board alone, or if you will be using a relayr's IoT Sensor Kit (incl. Arduino breakout board, Grove sensors and actuators, and others)
