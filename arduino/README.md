# Intel® Edison and the relayr Cloud (Arduino Edition)

## Introduction

This folder refers **only** to using **Arduino** on the Edison. For
information on using Python on the Edison, see the [Python instructions](https://github.com/relayr/edison/tree/master/python). It includes three different tutorials, depending on the hardware that you will be using. You may select it from the list below.

If you still have to assemble your Edison board, please refer to the main page of this repository [here](../README.md).

## Select Your Hardware

Before getting started, **select the model of the Fog-based Starter Kit you will be using from the list below**. relayr's Starter Kits include Vertex-enabled gateways, which require different configurations for your board.

On the other hand, **if you don't have a Starter Kit and want to run these examples with the Edison alone, or with an IoT Sensor Kit, simply choose the last option**.

* [IoT Acceleration Starter Kit](./README_Arduino_IoT_Acceleration_Starter_Kit.md)
(incl. hardware from Dell, Intel®, Bosch Connected Devices, and other vendors)
* [Industrial IoT Starter Kit](./README_Arduino_Industrial_IoT_Starter_Kit.md) (incl. hardware from Cisco, Intel®, ifm electronic, and other vendors)
* [I am not using any Starter Kit](./README_Arduino_Edison_Only.md). Select this option if you will be working with the Edison board alone, or if you will be using a relayr's IoT Sensor Kit (incl. Arduino breakout board, Grove sensors and actuators, and others)

## More About relayr's Fog-based Starter Kits
